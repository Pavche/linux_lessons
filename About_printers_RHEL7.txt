Name
lpstat - print cups status information
Synopsis
lpstat [ -E ] [ -H ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -l ] [ -W which-jobs ] [ -a [ destination(s) ] ] [ -c [ class(es) ] ] [ -d ] [ -o [ destination(s) ] ] [ -p [ printer(s) ] ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ -u [ user(s) ] ] [ -v [ printer(s) ] ]
Description
lpstat displays status information about the current classes, jobs, and printers. When run with no arguments, lpstat will list jobs queued by the current user.
Options
The lpstat command supports the following options:

-E
    Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
-H
    Shows the server hostname and port.
-R
    Shows the ranking of print jobs.
-U username
    Specifies an alternate username.
-W which-jobs
    Specifies which jobs to show, completed or not-completed (the default). This option must appear before the -o option and/or any printer names, otherwise the default (not-completed) value will be used in the request to the scheduler.
-a [printer(s)]
    Shows the accepting state of printer queues. If no printers are specified then all printers are listed.
-c [class(es)]
    Shows the printer classes and the printers that belong to them. If no classes are specified then all classes are listed.
-d
    Shows the current default destination.
-h server[:port]
    Specifies an alternate server.
-l
    Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.
-o [destination(s)]
    Shows the jobs queue on the specified destinations. If no destinations are specified all jobs are shown.
-p [printer(s)]
    Shows the printers and whether or not they are enabled for printing. If no printers are specified then all printers are listed.
-r
    Shows whether the CUPS server is running.
-s
    Shows a status summary, including the default destination, a list of classes and their member printers, and a list of printers and their associated devices. This is equivalent to using the "-d", "-c", and "-v" options.
-t
    Shows all status information. This is equivalent to using the "-r", "-d", "-c", "-v", "-a", "-p", and "-o" options.
-u [user(s)]
    Shows a list of print jobs queued by the specified users. If no users are specified, lists the jobs queued by the current user.
-v [printer(s)]
    Shows the printers and what device they are attached to. If no printers are specified then all printers are listed.

Compatibility
Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", and "#". Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

The "-h", "-E", "-U", and "-W" options are unique to CUPS.



MAN pages for lp
       -U username
            Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.
       -d destination
            Prints files to the named printer.
       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.
       -i job-id
            Specifies an existing job to modify.
       -n copies
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.
       -q priority
            Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest). The default priority is 50.
       -t "name"
            Sets the job name.
       -P page-list
            Specifies  which  pages  to  print  in the document. The list can contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#) separated by commas
            (e.g. 1,3-5,16). The page numbers refer to the output pages and not the document's original pages - options like "number-up" can
            affect the numbering of the pages.
COMMON JOB OPTIONS
       Aside from the printer-specific options reported by the lpoptions(1) command, the following generic options are available:

       -o media=size
            Sets the page size to size. Most printers support at least the size names "a4", "letter", and "legal".

       -o landscape

       -o orientation-requested=4
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees).

       -o sides=one-sided

       -o sides=two-sided-long-edge

       -o sides=two-sided-short-edge
            Prints  on  one  or  two sides of the paper. The value "two-sided-long-edge" is normally used when printing portrait (unrotated)
            pages, while "two-sided-short-edge" is used for landscape pages.

       -o fit-to-page
            Scales the print file to fit on the page.
       -o cpi=N
            Sets the number of characters per inch to use when printing a text file. The default is 10.

       -o lpi=N
            Sets the number of lines per inch to use when printing a text file. The default is 6.

       -o page-bottom=N

       -o page-left=N

       -o page-right=N

       -o page-top=N
            Sets the page margins when printing text files. The values are in points - there are 72 points to the inch.

EXAMPLES
       Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called "foo":
           lp -d foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename

       Print an image across 4 pages:
           lp -d bar -o scaling=200 filename

       Print a text file with 12 characters per inch, 8 lines per inch, and a 1 inch left margin:
           lp -d bar -o cpi=12 -o lpi=8 -o page-left=72 filename

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain any printable character except SPACE,  TAB,  "/",  or  "#".
       Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The  "q"  option accepts a different range of values than the Solaris lp command, matching the IPP job priority values (1-100, 100 is
       highest priority) instead of the Solaris values (0-39, 0 is highest priority).
