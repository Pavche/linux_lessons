About GNOME
GTK+ is a cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
It is one of the most popular toolkits for the Wayland and X11 windowing
systems, along with Qt.

Software architecture
The GTK+ library contains a set of graphical control elements (widgets).
GTK+ is an object-oriented widget toolkit written in the C programming language.
While GTK+ is primarily targeted at windowing systems based upon X11 and
Wayland, it works on other platforms, including Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.
There is also an HTML5 back-end called Broadway.

GTK+ can be configured to change the look of the widgets drawn; this is done
using different display engines. Several display engines exist which try to
emulate the look of the native widgets on the platform in use.
