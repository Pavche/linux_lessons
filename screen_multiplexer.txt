How to start a script for changing network settings on a remote machine?
6/25/2017
In this scenario we connect to a remote machine via SSH. An automated test from a bash script is started. The script changes the settings of several network interfaces where the SSH connection is disrupted. For example automated tests for NetworkManager.

Then how to see what happens on the remote machine?
How to see results from the tests.

DETACHED CONSOLE SESSIONS
One solution is to use software for screen multiplexing - screen.
Before the execution of the script, start the screen multiplexer.
From it, create a console session and give it a name. The session's type should be "detached".
screen -S <session name>

Be prepared to detach the console session with key strokes:
Ctrl+A, D

Start the script.
Detach the console session.

Event if changes in network settings interrupt the SSH connection to the remote machine, script's execution continues.

Reconnecting to the remote host requires at least one active network interface which is reachable via SSH.
When you log to the remote host again, attach the console session you've detached before. Use the command:
screen -r <session name>

See how the script has completed its execution.

To list sessions in detached state:
screen -ls

REMOTE CONNECTIONS VIA SERIAL CONSOLE
Another solution is to keep a remote uninterruptable connection via a serial port. This is more specific and conditions should be prepared in advance.
