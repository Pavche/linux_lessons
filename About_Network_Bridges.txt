NetworkManaqer can only attach Ethernet interfaces to a bridge. It does not support
aggregate interlaces, such as a learned or bonded interface.

Note that a bridge cannot be established over Wi-Fi networks operating in Ad-Hoc or Infrastructure
modes. This is due to the IEEE 802.11 standard that specifies the use of 3-address frames in Wi-Fi for
the efficient use of airtime.

When creating a bridge, if no interface name is specified, the name will default to bridge, bridge-1, bridge-2, and so on.

Warning
If you are configuring bridging on a remote host, and you are connected to that host over the physical NIC you are configuring, the connectivity maybe be lost.

To implement a software bridge on an existing teamed or bonded network interface
managed by NetworkManager, NetworkManager will have to be disabled since it only
supports bridges on simple Ethernet interfaces. Configuration files for the bridge will
have to be created by hand. The if up and if down utilities can be used to manage the
software bridge and other network interfaces.

When starting a bridge interface, NetworkManager waits for at least one port to enter the
"forwarding" state before beginning any network-dependent IP configuration such as DHCP or
IPv6 autoconfiguration. Static IP addressing is allowed to proceed before any slaves or ports are
connected or begin forwarding packets.

Spanning tree protocol (STP) is enabled by default. The values used are from the IEEE 802.1D -1998
standard.
The default bridge priority for 802.1D STP is 32768.
The allowed values are in the range 0 to 65535.
