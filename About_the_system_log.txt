About the system log

Analyzing the System Log
Last update:

Search for events with journalctl
The systemd journal stores logging data in a structured, indexed binary file.
In RHEL7, the systemd journal is stored in /run/log by default, and its contents are cleared after a reboot. This setting can be changed by the system administrator.
The journalctl command shows the full system journal, starting with the oldest log entry, when run as root user.

Task and command
Show the last 10 entries of the journal.
journalctl -n

Show the last 5 entries of the journal.
journalctl -n 5

Show the last 10 lines of the journal and continue to output new journal entries as they get written to the journal.
journalctl -f

Show events in specific time frame.
Show all journal entries that got recorded today
journalctl --since today

Show the journal entries from 29th March 2016 10:00 to 30th March 2016 17:00
journalctl --since "2016-03-29 10:00:00" --until "2016-03-30 17:00:00"

Show the events that originate from the systemd process that always runs with process id 1.
journalctl _PID=1

Show the journal messages with priority warning and above.
journalctl -p warning

Show the journal messages with priority error and above.
journalctl -p err
List of priorities:
debug (7), info (6), notice (5), warning (4), err (3), crit (2), alert (1), and emerg (0)

Show all log events recorded in the previous 10 minutes. The command assumes a current time of 9:15.
journalctl --since 9:05:00 --until 9:15:00

Show only the events originating from the sshd service with the system unit file sshd.service.
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT="sshd.service"


By default, the systemd journal is kept in /run/log/journal, which means it is cleared when the system reboots. The journal is a new mechanism in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and for most installations, a detailed journal that starts with the last boot is sufficient.
If the directory /var/log/journal exists, the journal will log to that directory instead. The advantage of this is the historic data will be available immediately at boot. However, even with a persistent journal, not all data will be kept forever. The journal has a built-in log rotation mechanism that will trigger monthly. In addition, by default, the journal will not be allowed to get larger than 10% of the file system it is on, or leave less than 15% of the file system free. These values can be tuned in /etc/systemd/journald.conf, and the current limits on the size of the journal are logged when the systemd-journald process starts, as can be seen by the following command, which shows the top two lines of journalctl output:
journalctl | head -2

Store the system journal permanently. Make the systemd journal persistent by creating the directory /var/log/journal as user root.
mkdir -p /var/log/journal

Restart journald to apply the change.
systemctl restart systemd-journald

Ensure that the /var/log/journal directory is owned by the root user and group systemd-journal, and has the permissions 2755.
chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journalctl
chmod 2755 /var/log/journal

Show the log messages since the last boot of the system.
journalctl -b

Show the log since the previous boot. When debugging a system crash with a persistent journal, it is usually required to limit the journal query to the reboot before the crash happened.
journalctl -b -1 (a negative number)
